# ladder

Incremental buying or selling of any crypto asset

# reason to be

Trading crypto is a game of dealing with harsh volatility and the uncertainties of timing the market. Most traders get it wrong. Throw in human emotions and all you get is anxiety rather than profits. Ladder trading is a strategy to minimize the risks and reap greater rewards. This software automates the strategy while removing human emotions.

# what is latter trading?

Ladder trading is incremental buying or selling of any crypto asset rather than opting for a single price. These incremental buy or sell orders are called ladder steps. Ladder trading will limit your losses during the market fluctuations by spreading in and out of positions. 

Should you want to exit the market and sell your asset, your average sell price will be closer to the ATH. Should you want to enter the market and buy an asset, you'll be buying dips and your average buy price will be closer to the bottom. Either way, you'll maximize your profits by pushing the average price in the desired direction.

In essence, you are executing a better dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) trading strategy where you are selling (or buying) an asset regularly, doing away with the attempt at the market timing. Because this software will slowly but surely increase your order size, your average price will be better.
